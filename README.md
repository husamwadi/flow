# flow
> Flow is a chrome extension that fosters the mental well-being of its users through beautiful images, tranquil music, and personal-reflection tools. It is accompanied by a web application, which allows organizations of all sizes to better connect to their members; from the web application, organization administrators can invite members to channels on the chrome extension, create and send announcements and surveys - which are subtly rendered on the extension to the users - and visualize the data from survey responses. We hope that Flow will brighten users' days and promote a more positive community for organizations, one tab at a time.
